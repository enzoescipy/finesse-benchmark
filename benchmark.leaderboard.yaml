# Finesse Benchmark: Official Leaderboard Configuration

# This YAML serves as the official standard configuration for leaderboard submissions.
# To submit results, copy this file to benchmark.yaml and run the evaluation.
# It ensures fairness, reproducibility, and alignment with Finesse's core philosophy of evaluating
# composition (synthesis) without artificial masking.

# Do NOT modify this file for submissions. Use it as-is for standardized scoring.

mode: "merger_mode"  # Standard: merger_mode for sequence-merger evaluations. Change only if comparing native/BYOK modes explicitly.

# Models Configuration (Standard for Leaderboard)
models:
  # Sequence Merger (core for merger_mode)
  merger:
    name: "enzoescipy/sequence-merger-malgeum"  # Official merger model; use your fine-tuned variant if submitting custom
  # Base Embedder (used in merger_mode and as probe embedder)
  base_embedder:
    name: "intfloat/multilingual-e5-base"  # Standard multilingual base for global coverage
  # Native Embedder (for native_mode comparisons)
  native_embedder:
    name: "Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0"  # Reference long-context embedder

  # BYOK Example (Uncomment for external APIs; set env vars for keys)
  # byok_embedder:
  #   provider: "openai"
  #   name: "text-embedding-3-large"

# Dataset Configuration (Fixed for Reproducibility)
dataset:
  path: "enzoescipy/finesse-benchmark-database"  # Official dataset
  split: "train"  # Use train split for consistency

# Probe Configuration (Standard for Leaderboard)
# Balances short-to-medium sequence evaluation with sufficient samples for statistical significance
probe_config:
  sequence_length:
    min: 4   # Minimum length: Tests basic composition
    max: 32  # Maximum length: Tests scaling up to moderate long-context
  samples_per_length: 25  # Samples per length: Ensures reliable averages (25 evals per point)

# Advanced Settings (Defaults for Fair Comparison)
advanced:
  batch_size: 8   # Efficient batching; adjust based on hardware
  device: "cuda"   # Use GPU if available; falls back to CPU

# Seed for Reproducibility (Immutable for Leaderboard)
seed: 42  # Fixed seed: Ensures identical dataset shuffling and randomness across runs
